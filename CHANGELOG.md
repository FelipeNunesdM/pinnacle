# Changelog

- [Wlr-layer-shell support](https://github.com/Ottatop/pinnacle/pull/45) is now here!
Now you can use stuff like [swaybg](https://github.com/swaywm/swaybg) so you don't have
to look at an ugly gray background and [eww](https://github.com/elkowar/eww)
for widgets (until I implement a widget system, that is). As always, if you find any
issues, submit a bug report!

<summary>Older stuff</summary>

- We now have XWayland support as of [#34](https://github.com/Ottatop/pinnacle/pull/34)!
It's currently not that polished right now because I got bored of working on it and I want
to work on other aspects of Pinnacle, but it should be at least *usable*.
